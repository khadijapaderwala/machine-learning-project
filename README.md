# Machine Learning

## Description

The aim of this practical was to build accurate machine learning models using metabolomic data from different sample types and use these models to diagnose Crohn’s disease. Crohn’s disease is an inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. Studies have shown there are notable difference in metabolomic profiles in patients with Crohn’s disease compared to healthy patients. Metabolomic data was collected from diseased and controlled patients from the blood, faeces, urine, and breath using gas chromatography mass spectrometry (GCMS). During GCMS, the samples are first heated to release volatile compounds. They are then detected by mass spectrometry which determines the mass of the metabolites as they elude from the chromatography column. Further fragmentation is then done to give more specific information about the structure of the metabolites. Using information about the mass and structure, the metabolites can then be identified.

The two machine learning models used in this experiment were support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF) classifier. SVM model works by creating an optimal margin boundary between classes. Random forest classifier contains many decision trees which give a class prediction, each class is predicted by majority voting of these trees.
